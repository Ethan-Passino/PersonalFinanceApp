# 💰 Personal Finance App

### A sleek and intuitive WPF-based personal finance application for tracking income, expenses, and more! Built with SQLite for data storage, this app makes it easy to stay on top of your financial goals.  

# Dev Note

~~Currently taking a bit of a break updating this while working on NodeChat. Don't worry, I'll come back as I use this application everyday and would like to make some changes!~~
Back to working on this project have a few things I want to fix at the very least:
- ~~Change records page to order the transactions and paystubs by the date you put in their specific fields rather than creation date.~~
- Fix records page to properly display all paystubs.
